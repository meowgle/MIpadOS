# MOSM
the Operating system for the MIpad and other microcontroller baised devices.

when there is a loading bar on boot that means it is loading the kernel
and system controls
# Controls
"#" = reboot

"*" = enter menu

and any other key is just a typing key

# troubleshooting
if you get a bunch of weird text on your screen do not worry 
just reset the board and it will be normal "sometimes".
