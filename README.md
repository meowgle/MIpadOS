# MIpadOS
the Operating system for the MIpad
MIpad OS is a custom verison of "Meowgle OS for Microcontrollers"
or "MOSM" 

when there is a loading bar on boot that means it is loading the kernel
and system controls
# Controls
"#" = clear text

"*" = show stop watch

and any other key is just a typing key

# troubleshooting
if you get a bunch of weird text on your screen do not worry 
just reset the board and it will be normal "sometimes".
